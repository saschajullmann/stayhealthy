			    Like a forest or a garden or a field, an honest page of letters can absorb &ndash;
			    and will repay &ndash; as much attention as it is given. Much type now, however, is
			    composed not for the page but for the screen of a computer. That screen can be
			    alive with flowing color, but the best computer monitors have dismal resolution
			    (about 130 dpi: one fifth the current norm for laser printers and roughly 5% of
			    the norm for professional digital typesetting). When the text is crudely
			    rendered, the eye goes looking for distraction, which the screen is all too
			    able to provide.
			  </p>
			  <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy dark-gray">
			    The screen mimics the sky, not the earth. It bombards the eye with light
			    instead of waiting to repay the gift of vision. It is not simultaneously
			    restful and lively, like a field full of flowers, or the face of a thinking
			    human being, or a well-made typographic page. And we read the screen the way
			    we read the sky: in quick sweeps, guessing at the weather from the changing
			    shapes of clouds, or like astronomers, in magnified small bits, examining
			    details. We look to it for clues and revelations more than wisdom. This makes
			    it an attractive place for advertising and dogmatizing, but not so good a
			    place for thoughtful text.
			  </p>
			  <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy dark-gray">
			    The screen, in other words, is a reading environment even more fugitive than
			    the newspaper. Intricate long sentences full of unfamiliar words stand little
			    chance. At text size, subtle and delicate letterforms stand little chance as
			    well. Superscripts and subscripts, footnotes, endnotes, sidenotes disappear. In
			    the harsh light and coarse resolution of the screen such accessories are
			    difficult to see; what is worse, they dispel the essential illusion of speed.
			    so the links and jumps of hypertext replace them. All the subtexts then can be
			    the same size and readers are at liberty to skip from text to text like
			    children switching channels on tv. When reading takes this form, sentences and
			    letterforms retreat to blunt simplicity. Forms bred on newsprint and signage
			    are most likely to survive.
